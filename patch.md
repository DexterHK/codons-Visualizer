To Patch in this Branch:
1. C3 visualization, so we can show 3 graphs, first one is the original codon, second is the Alph1 and last is alph2
2. Circular is only circular if the arrows are in the right order. DONE
3. Import fix, when you import, you take the default length of the codons. DONE
4. Fixing the graph, cut after 1-23 ,  3-12 length is 3
5. 123-4, 12-34, 4-123 => length is 4
6. 1-2 => Length is 2
